    In this project, I deepened my expertise in React by working extensively with modern development tools and best practices.
     I integrated the powerful code editor from @monaco-editor/react to provide an in-browser code editor.
     I structured the project using reusable components, managed state effectively with React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.), 
     and maintained clean communication between components through props.
     API integration was handled using Axios, connecting the frontend to a custom Python backend for executing and debugging user code.
