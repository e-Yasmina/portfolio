    moreInfo:`Each activity comes with detailed explanations, instructions, and test cases to help students practice and improve their Python programming skills.</br>
    In this project, I deepened my expertise in React by working extensively with modern development tools and best practices.
     I integrated the powerful code editor from @monaco-editor/react to provide an in-browser code editor.
     I structured the project using reusable components, managed state effectively with React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.), 
     and maintained clean communication between components through props.
     API integration was handled using Axios, connecting the frontend to a custom Python backend for executing and debugging user code.

I implemented real-time collision detection, score updates, and an intuitive player control system. The use of raw WebGL2 helped me understand low-level graphics rendering, matrix transformations, and buffer handling. `,

I focused on building a clean, user-friendly interface using Android's XML layout system. Java was used to handle core logic, including data management and alert scheduling. I implemented a feature for selecting and displaying medicine images from the user's device, ensuring a personalized experience. The notification system was designed using Androidâ€™s alarm and notification APIs to remind users about their medicine timings. This app strengthened my skills in Android development, especially in UI design, notification management, and working with device resources.`,
